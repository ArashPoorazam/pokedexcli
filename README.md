# Pokedexcli

Pokedex in a command-line REPL!!!
Just like in the Pokemon game, our Pokedex will only allow players to see details about a Pokemon if they have seen it before (or in our case, caught it)
The main purpose of a Pokedex is to keep track of all the Pokemon you've caught. Gotta catch 'em all!
